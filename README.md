**Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**
**Overview**
This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning models. We implemented and optimized various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to achieve the best possible predictions. The process involved comprehensive data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The models were evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix, with results visualized through Seaborn.
